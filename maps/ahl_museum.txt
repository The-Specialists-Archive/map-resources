------About This Map-------------------------------------------------

I wanted to do one final map for Action Half-Life and decided this would be a good theme. I had a lot of it 'in my head' so to speak, especially the long middle area and the 'art alcoves'. The larger room took a lot of additional planning and optimizing, though!

I *think* I covered everyone there, it's hard to keep track of everything on a map like this x_x  If I used your work and didn't list you, let me know and I will update this file to reflect your work!


------Art & Photography Credits------------------------------------------------

My friend Carey, goth girl of d00m. Her art is in the small gallery with the plant. The Velveteen Rabbit & other art there are hers. No. She is not a furry.

------Additional Info, Tips, and Notes-------------------------------

"Detail textures" are available in this map. Please type "detail_textures 1" in the console to turn them on. They seem to cause a tiny bit of lag, but your milage may vary and they make the walls etc. look less blurry up close. Mappers are welcome to use these on their own maps if they want (they aren't that great tbh), just give a link to my website in your .txt credits.
